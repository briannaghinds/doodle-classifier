## REO Presents 
# Code Crisis: 24HR Hackathon
Mingo, HCU's beloved mascot, is trapped in a virtual snowstorm. Your mission is to bring Mingo safely back to campus by solving a series of challenges that test your problem solving skills and creativity. Each step will get you closer to saving Mingo!

**Here is a summary of what the challenge is:**
1. Decode Mingo's location.
2. Map the Campus.
3. Solve the puzzles to unlock the safe path to Mingo.
4. Navigate the snowstorm.
5. Decode Mingo's SOS signal.
6. Bring Mingo home.

# Phase 1: Decode the Message
**GOAL: Find out where the mission begins.**
Mingo is trapped in a location, and you have interceped a coded distress message. The message is encoded in a ***Caesar Cipher***

> Hints:
> - Caesar Cipher uses a shift of 3.
> - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/
>

**Phase 1 Task**: Make a Python script that takes the message.txt file and decodes it to give you Mingo's location that will be used for Phase 2.

EXAMPLE
```Python
# INPUT: "Wklv lv d whvw phvvdjh"
# OUTPUT: "This is a test message"
```

---

# Phase 2: Map the Location
**GOAL: After decoding the message, plot the coordinates on a map.**

Once the message (a latitude and longitude coordinate) is decoded, plot the the coordinates on a map. Use libraries such as Folium or Matplotlib to map the location. 

**Phase 2 Task**: Write a small script to render a pin on a map using a mapping library or an API, such as Folium in Python or Google Maps in Javascript (NOT SUBJECT TO THESE TWO RESOURCES. YOUR MAPPING CHOICE IS UP TO YOUR DISCRETION).

> BONUS POINTS: Add functionality to zoom in and display a custom label.

# Phase 3: Build a Puzzle Solver
**GOAL: After entering a location, solve a simple logic puzzle.**

---

# Phase 4: Navigate the Snowstorm.
**GOAL:**

---

# Phase 5: Build a Puzzle Solver
**GOAL:**

---

# Phase 6: Bring Mingo Home (FINAL CHALLENGE)
**GOAL: Integrate all the previous phases to complete the mission and safely bring Mingo back to HCU.**
